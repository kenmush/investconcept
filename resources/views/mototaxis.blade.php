                    <h5>Moto Taxis</h5>

                    <p>
                        Moto-taxis are the haemoglobin of the urban and peri-urban economy in Africa, moving people,
                        goods, and livestock through hub cities in volumes unmatched by any other vehicle class. Faster
                        and cheaper on two wheels than four, the moto-taxi is an organic solution to local challenges,
                        and a great business opportunity for enterprising youths making their first moves in the city.
                        With their services in constant demand, young riders rent a bike and start earning immediately,
                        as the purchase cost of even a second-hand vehicle is far beyond the average budget. A
                        comfortable, safe, and reliable bike lets a determined entrepreneur make a decent living day
                        after day â€“ The ability to access a quality machine on credit is a stepping stone between
                        dangerous, poorly compensated labour and more stable and self-directed livelihood.
