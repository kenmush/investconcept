                    <p>Most governments in Africa are still grappling with the sharp population growth of recent
                        decades. Nowhere is the shortfall in infrastructure more acute than in provision of water.
                        Private efforts have rapidly filled the vacuum, allowing vendors to supply their communities
                        with water where the local authorities cannot. The revolution in digital payment and monitoring
                        technologies has not only de-risked this market for local businesspeople, but also improved the
                        qualityand safety for end-users</p>
